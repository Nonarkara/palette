# Palette — agent contract

For typography decisions, read `skills/bringhurst-contextual-type/SKILL.md`.
Proof actual content, role and script before changing fonts. The reading-room
chapter and `TYPOGRAPHY-FIELD-GUIDE.md` teach the method without changing the
colour-field product or granting automatic house-rule exceptions.

For era, nostalgia or any surface without a named reference, read
`skills/humanized-nostalgia-design/SKILL.md` and call the `humanized-design`
MCP (`mcp/index.mjs`) before styling.

## Purpose

Palette is an interactive exhibition of Sanzo Wada's 348 colour combinations.
The colour field is the product. The interface is museum hardware.

For authored-design work, read `skills/bauhaus-human-design/SKILL.md`. It adds
content-led composition, communication and observed-task gates above style
compliance; it does not override these conservation laws. Longer design writing
lives in `reading.html`, not over the colour field. Source-book files stay private.

## Conservation law

One source-verified combination owns the viewport. Interface chrome never
competes with it.

## Commands

```bash
npm test
npm run check
npm run dev
```

## Sacred constraints

- Never replace the full-viewport colour field with cards or a conventional gallery.
- No rounded corners, gradients, drop shadows, visible borders, custom cursors, or decorative texture.
- Keep every action keyboard-operable and every target at least 44 × 44 CSS pixels.
- Colour is never the only carrier: plate number, names, count, and text remain available.
- Thai uses non-looped faces and `lang="th"`; Chinese is Simplified and uses `lang="zh-Hans"`.
- Do not call RGB/hex values the exact printed colours. They are the credited digital conversion.
- Do not invent Wada plate numbers, names, quotations, or historical claims.
- User-facing prose must stay plain. No AI marketing language.
- Preserve upstream attribution in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `data/colors.json`.

## Ship

Commit with `Agent: codex`, push to `main`, deploy through GitHub Pages, then
exercise search, navigation, dialogs, copy, keyboard controls, and mobile layout
on the live URL.

## Anti-slop design rules (hard rules)

These are known AI design-slop patterns. Never re-create them. Check every page before shipping; fix any hit. They sit on top of Palette and any map-first rule.

1. **Boxes fit their content.** No text box, card, button or panel much wider or taller than its text. Padding follows type size (~0.5–1.5× line height). No fixed/min heights that leave empty space under short text.
2. **Balanced composition.** Deliberate grid; visual weight balanced. No heavy side with an empty side, no orphan block. Squint-test at desktop, tablet and phone.
3. **Readable line length (A4/A5).** Body ~45–75 characters (ideally 60–70); CSS `max-width: 65ch`. Thai/Chinese keep the same physical measure (~30–45 Chinese chars). Wide screens get columns or margins, never full-width paragraphs.
4. **No AI-slop fonts.** Banned as primary: Inter, Poppins, Montserrat, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, DM Sans, Space Grotesk, Geist, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope, Nunito, system-ui-as-design-font. Prefer Bauhaus/Bayer Universal lookalikes: **Jost** first, Josefin Sans or League Spartan for display, Prompt or Kanit for Thai; matching geometric sans for Chinese. At most two families per product.
5. **No lazy ornaments.** No decorative boxes, borders, cards, dividers, blobs, gradients, glows or icon tiles only to fill or "balance". Every container groups things that belong together; if removing it loses no meaning, remove it. No emoji-as-icons, decorative stock icons, or generic gradient heroes.
6. **Clear hierarchy: something must win.** One obvious first look (hero number, map, headline), then second and third. Real contrast in size (≥1.5–2× type step), weight, colour and space. No equal-weight card grids. Squint-test must show a focal point.
7. **More slop to kill.** Centre-everything / symmetric card grids by default; fake depth (stacked shadows, glassmorphism, same radius everywhere); vague slogan heroes; filler copy ("Unlock the power…", "Seamless", "Revolutionize") and fake stats; too many colours (one meaningful accent); thick chrome that shrinks content; icons/badges on every line; dense same-size grey text.

**Pre-ship:** screenshot at 1440 / 1024 / 390; list hits against 1–7; fix; re-screenshot; different agent/person reviews — never self-review.
